-- flood maybe???

-- notes: 
make sure you're running this inside of the console. this was made for sandbox and garrys mod. this script might not work for all maps, as i only tested it
on a few maps, sorry!

-- STARTUP:

lua_run P=pairs f=ents.FindByName c=concommand.Add c('fstart',function(p)if!p:IsAdmin()then
return end for _,e in P(f'water')do e:Fire'open'end end)c('fend',function(p)if!p:IsAdmin()then
return end for _,e in P(f'water')do e:Fire'close'end end)

-- STARTING

"`fstart" 

will start the flooding and drowning scripts needed.

"`fend" will drain the map and remove the drowning.

-- OTHERS

lua_run for _,e in pairs(ents.FindByName'water_hurt')do e:Remove()end

-- the above script removes the drowning function, even if the map is flooding. do note that you have to restart the map if you run this script into the console.
